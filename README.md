# Alarmuino Tempsor

## An alarm clock with display, that can also be turned off by waving your hand over the motion sensor. 

### Product Evolution:
v1.0 - LCD Alarm Clock that displays temperature, humidity, and the alarm can also be turned off by a motion sensor. (currently here)

* This series of arduino projects is a basic configuration for [Tamadoro](https://github.com/synthline/Tamadoro), a device combining the functionality of Pomodoro and the fun of a Tamagotchi.*
&nbsp;
* This project is a collection of other Arduino projects that were combined and tweaked. The list of the inspiration projects can be found both in the code as comments as well as a document under [resources](/resources).
